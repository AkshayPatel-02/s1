# ScrutinX Real Data Integration

This document outlines the changes made to remove mock data and use real contract data in the ScrutinX voting application.

## Changes Made

### 1. Server-Side Changes

#### `server/src/routes.ts`
- Removed the mock implementation in the user-deposits endpoint
- Updated the endpoint to only use the real `relayerAllowance` function from the contracts
- Removed fallback mechanisms that were returning mock data

#### `server/server.js`
- Simplified the user-deposits endpoint to only fetch real data
- Removed all mock data generation and fallback mechanisms
- Improved error handling to return proper error responses instead of mock data

### 2. Client-Side Changes

#### `src/contexts/Web3Context.tsx`
- Updated the `getUserDeposits` function to only use real contract data
- Removed all mock data fallbacks that were returning hardcoded values
- Improved error handling to return 0 instead of mock values when errors occur

#### `src/services/relayerService.ts`
- Removed the mock data check in the `getUserDeposits` function
- Simplified the function to only process real data from the API

#### `src/pages/UserDashboard.tsx`
- Added a refresh button to allow users to manually refresh their balance data
- Improved the UI to better handle the case when no data is available

## Benefits

1. **Accuracy**: Users now see their actual contract balances instead of mock data
2. **Transparency**: The application clearly shows when no data is available instead of showing fake values
3. **Reliability**: The code is simpler and more maintainable without the mock data logic

## Testing

To test these changes:

1. Connect your wallet to the application
2. Verify that your actual contract balances are displayed
3. Use the refresh button to update the balances
4. Deposit or withdraw funds to see the balances update in real-time

## Next Steps

1. Add more detailed error messages when contract interactions fail
2. Implement loading indicators during contract data fetching
3. Add transaction history for deposits and withdrawals
